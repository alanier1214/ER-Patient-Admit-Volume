# Creates Variables: Shift, Season
Sanford_ED <- Sanford_ED %>%
  #mutate(DateTime = Date) %>%
  mutate(Shift = (Hour %/% 6) + 1, .after = Hour)  %>%
  mutate(Year = year(Date), .after = Date) %>%
  mutate(Season = (month(Date) + 2) %/% 3, .after = Year)

# Calculates Elapsed Time in Dataset
Timeframe.Start <- as.POSIXct("2018-01-01 00:00:00", tz="America/Chicago")

Total_Hours <- as.numeric(difftime(Timeframe.End, Timeframe.Start, units = "hours"))

# Creates Table for every hour in time
Timeframe.Hours.DF <- data.frame(
  DateTime = seq(
    from = Timeframe.Start,
    to = Timeframe.End,
    by = "hour"
  )
)

#left_join(Timeframe.Hours.DF, )
```
## Data Filtering
  Need to check if all hours represented, if columns still correspond after table manipulation. May not be accurate or even work before check. Switched variable names to be more descriptive and clear. Will need to check later plotting for consistency.
